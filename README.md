# Bevy TUI

A plugin for making interactive Bevy applications with a TUI instead of a graphical interface.

This project started as a way to create an administrative client for monitoring the health and status of game servers without adding significant load to them. It occurred to me that properly fleshed out this could be useful in the environment for other projects such as terminal based roguelikes and text adventure games.

This plugin is currently under heavy and active development and is not quite ready for use.

## Continous Integration
